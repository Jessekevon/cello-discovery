					  <p>The beginner cirriculum is designed for the student with no prior experience playing the cello. Very detailed lessons are presented to teach the student everything from how to unpack the cello as well as where  to find a good cello.  There are dozens of lessons to watch BEFORE the first sounds are ever made on the cello. All the material is presented in a very detailed and logical order so that the new student will be successful in their quest to become a cellist.</p>

					  <p>The intermediate student may have played the cello in middle school or perhaps even high school, yet never fully learned the instrument to the extent they had hoped to. Cello Discovery intermediate level videos gives the learner a good place to jump back in. With this class level, the student can follow a sequential curriculum or search particular key words in order to fill-in the knowledge deficiencies.</p>

					  <p>The advanced cello student is a well established cellist will a solid proficiency of both right and left hand techniques. However, this student might want to perfect the vibrato or learn how to play more fluidly in the upper positions. Cello Discovery has an ever expanding library to help the advanced learner reach their goals.</p>

							<p>Carolyn Hagler is a stellar teacher! She provides rigorous instruction in a fun atmosphere that makes her students fall in love with music! Moreover, Carolyn makes kids believe in themselves and their abilities. She positively impacts students as individuals in addition to making them excellent musicians. Having Carolyn as a teacher is a life changing experience for (beginning) musicians.</p>

							<p>Carolyn Hagler is not only a wonderful cellist and teacher, but also a great person. As a cellist and teacher she always strives for excellence while masterfully weaving motivation and fun into every lesson. Her middle school orchestra students always arrived at my program at the high school with a clear understanding of good tone and clear intonation. They were all well setup and produced a beautiful and full tone. When I would go visit her at the middle school, I always enjoyed watching her teach. She always demonstrated a wonderful combination of focus and high standards, in an environment where empathy understanding were king. As a person, Carolyn is a caring individual with a very fun personality. I highly recommend her as a cello teacher.</p>
